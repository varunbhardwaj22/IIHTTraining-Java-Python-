// Assignment : Write a Program to identify if a value is even & is square or multiple of previous value.
//              e.g. first value = 2, then I gave 4 then it should say 4 is a square & multiple of 2
//              e.g. first value = 2, then I gave 6 then it should say 6 is a multiple of 2 = 3s of 2
//              e.g. first value = 2 , then I gave 3 then it should 3 is neither a square nor a multiple of 2
